A site full of usefully useless stuff and things

The first goal of this site is to add information from extensions from each Maryland about the best crops to plant
as well as information about lesser-known green spaces within the state.
The next goal would be to create an environmental dashboard focused on the Chesapeake Bay,
the state of Maryland, then slowly expanded to other states, and eventually, the Bahamas.


# Environmental Health Dashboard

Using either Go, Odin, or Python, I would like to gather data from trustworthy sources
about key environmental factors affecting various states in the US as well as
the country of the Bahamas. Initially, this will be focused on Maryland, DC, Virginia,
and the Bahamas but my hope is for this to cover all 50 states as well as some
other international destinations depending on the amount and quality of the data.  

## Long term goals

The long-term goals of this project are to determine what factors are most
important in determining the health of the environment as well as the best way
to subdivide areas (by county, by zone, by state, etc) as well as to distill this
information into a concise series of charts to get a general idea of environmental conditions at a glance.
Currently, my thoughts are to track keystone species, as well as the habitat of
endangered species in addition to the health of the water, soil quality, and air
quality, among other factors. My initial thoughts are to use sources such as NOAA
and Audubon to track weather and species habitats.

        The purpose of this website is twofold. The primary goal is to practice my data illustration skills and
        build my toolkit as a data scientist, but also to have a collection of graphs, or charts, or anything
        that may be useful to someone; even if it may not be useful to me.

        The current focus of this project is to develop an environmental dashboard which starts with the Chesapeake Bay
        area
        but eventually grows to encompass the entirety of the US as well as the Bahamas. This dashboard will consist
        of a population tracker for keystone species, water quality levels, air quality, and endangered species tracker.
        For each state, native flora and fauna will be on display as well as an expandable dashboard which can give a
        detailed
        report on the health of an ecosystem divided by state.

    <h2>Things to currently do:</h2>
    <p>
        Currently the main feature of the website is the playground. It is an svg file from a forgotten author;
        with all of the state svg files coming from the wikicommons. The eventual goal is to make each state
        clickable (only a handful currently are) and then within each state there will be a populated table
        (with pictures) of native plants and vegetable planting schedules for the state/county.

        So, go forth and adventure around this Usefully Useless arena!

    <h2>The Future</h2>
    <p>
        First and foremost, we need to gather data! Data as far as the eye can see so that it can be processed into
        meaningful
        graphs and plots. So after the site has been fully converted to PHP, the hunt for data will continue!
